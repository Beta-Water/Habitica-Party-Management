## 队伍宗旨 · Team Purpose :star2:

The meaning of life is to live, and we should dare to fight against the crisis of nihilism with existentialism.

Let’s use Habitica together, enjoy every minute of the present, and cherish the irreplaceable moments of life!

Feel free to share experiences or ask questions in the chat, help each other, and grow together!

## 规则 · Rules :traffic_light:

Normally, we will end the participation of the next quest at **15 o'clock** on the day after the completion of the previous one. (UTC + 0)

However, in order to ensure the efficient completion of the quest, after 10 hours or more, we will directly start it if only a minority of those who were **already logged** in that day are not involved. (I'm sorry if not everyone has been taken care of.)

Therefore, if you care a lot about quest participation, I strongly recommend that you keep a close eye on its completion to predict when the next quest will open to avoid missing it.

Anyone can initiate a quest, but they need to complete the same series in order first. (If all of the same series are completed, you can choose what you like.)

We only use your **last login time** to determine if you're still using habitica, so don't worry too much about it.

### b. Existentialism & Nihilism

**Existentialism** is a philosophical movement that focuses on individual freedom, choice, self, and the meaning of existence. Its central idea is that "existence precedes essence," meaning that humans are born without predetermined purpose or essence, and individuals must create their own meaning and value. Existentialism emphasizes autonomy and responsibility, asserting that everyone has the right to choose their own path in life, which is filled with risks and uncertainties.

Thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus explored the absurdity of life and human desire for meaning. In Sartre's philosophy, he famously stated that humans are "condemned to be free," implying that individuals must bear the consequences of their choices. In Camus' "The Myth of Sisyphus," he uses the allegory of Sisyphus pushing the boulder to illustrate life’s absurdity; despite the meaningless task, Sisyphus finds freedom through acceptance and rebellion against this reality.

**Nihilism** is a philosophical viewpoint that posits that life lacks inherent meaning or value. Nihilists question the existence of morals, knowledge, and purpose, arguing that everything is ultimately meaningless. The crisis of nihilism can lead to profound despair and a sense of helplessness, as individuals may feel that all efforts are futile.

Existentialism counters nihilism with its core tenets. When confronting the crisis of nihilism, existentialism offers several key strategies:

1. **Accepting the Absurd**: Existentialism acknowledges the absurdity of life. By accepting this absurdity, individuals can liberate themselves from the pressure to find meaning, allowing them to create their own way of living more freely.

2. **Self-Creation**: Existentialists propose that the meaning of life is not inherent but rather created. Through self-reflection, choice, and action, individuals can imbue their lives with personal significance. This means that even in a seemingly meaningless world, people can find their own values through their decisions and experiences.

3. **Agency in Life**: Existentialism encourages individuals to live actively rather than passively accept their fate. By actively engaging in life, forming connections with others, and pursuing personal goals, individuals can experience a sense of meaning and resist the effects of nihilism.

4. **Taking Responsibility**: Existentialism stresses the importance of personal responsibility for one's choices. By embracing the consequences of their decisions, individuals can shape their destinies, avoiding the feelings of helplessness that accompany nihilism.
