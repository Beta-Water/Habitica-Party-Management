## 📝 File Overview

### GitHub Actions Automation Workflow

In the `.github/workflows/automated_party_management.yml` file, a GitHub Actions workflow is defined to automate team member management. It triggers every 10 minutes or can be manually invoked, running in an Ubuntu environment with several key steps:

1. **Checkout Code**: Retrieve the project code.
2. **Set Up Python Environment**: Configure Python 3.8.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary `requests` library.
4. **Execute Management Script**: Run the Python script for managing members (`manage_members.py`), utilizing environment variables to manage user credentials.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Introduce pauses to manage request rates.
6. **Run Update Script**: Execute the script to update descriptions (`update_description.py`), also using environment variables.
7. **Log Changes**: Commit updates from the log generated by the scripts back to the repository.
8. **Push Changes**: Push the updated logs back to the remote repository.

This workflow is designed to efficiently automate the management of team members and the updating of logs—what a smart assistant! 🤖

### License File

The `LICENSE` file follows the Apache License 2.0, which serves as a permissive open-source software license outlining terms and conditions for using, reproducing, and distributing the software and other works. It grants users rights to modify and distribute the works while ensuring appropriate attribution to the original authors. Additionally, the file includes terms for trademark usage, liability disclaimers, and limitations of liability. This document aims to foster cooperation among developers and promote user access, maintaining software freedom while protecting the rights of the original authors.

### Dependency File

The `requirements.txt` file lists the external packages and libraries required to run the project. In this project, it only includes the `requests` library, a widely-used Python module that allows developers to easily send HTTP requests and interact with web services and APIs. With the simple command `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you can quickly install these dependencies and kick off your magical journey! ✨

### Script Files

- **Member Management Script `manage_members.py`**

  This script is designed to manage members of the Habitica team and performs the following key functions:

  1. **Logging**: Uses the logging module to record operations and errors, storing them in rotating log files and outputting important information to the console.
  2. **Rate-Limited API Requests**: Defines a helper function to ensure requests adhere to specified intervals.
  3. **User Management**: Retrieves the team member list, checks for inactive members, and removes them.
  4. **Message Sending**: Can send private messages to users and post member invitations and removal messages in team chats.
  5. **Inviting New Users**: Sends invitations to new users looking for a team and notifies the team in the chat.

  With these functions, this script greatly simplifies the management of Habitica team members, making community management much more enjoyable! 🎈

- **Update Description Script `update_description.py`**

  This script automatically updates the Habitica team description by integrating daily quotes and member activity information. Its main functions include:

  1. **Rate-Limited API Requests**: Manages the interval between requests to prevent overloading the Habitica API.
  2. **Daily Quote Retrieval**: Fetches daily quotes from an external API, obtaining both the English content and translations.
  3. **Member Data Collection**: Collects information about team members, including last login time and the duration of their last activity.
  4. **Description Formatting**: Reads the Markdown template and formats it with current content, member information, and timestamps.
  5. **Update Submission**: Sends the updated description back to the Habitica API.

  Through such automation, this script continuously enhances the appeal of the team description and member interactions—it’s like having an artistic friend! 🎨
